Attempt to create a chess game from scratch
Incomplete due to project being done solo when it was meant to be done as a group/time limitation

MVC style chess program built in Java using the swing library
Each chess piece is an abstract class that implements custom versions of the move() method according to valid moves for said piece
The chess board state is kept in the model and displayed via the view, both are handled by the controller
